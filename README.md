# Extended Kalman Filter Analysis with Python

An analysis of the Extended Kalman Filter ([Original Code from AtsushiSaka](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master/Localization/extended_kalman_filter)) using Python's multithreading and multiprocessing libraries, and comparing the advantages of using the IntelÂ® Distribution for Python* and the Anaconda (Base) distributions. Factors such as CPU usage, CPU load per core, Memory, and wall-time are analyzed.
